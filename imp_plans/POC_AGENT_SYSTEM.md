# Product Requirements Document: POC Agent System

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** Draft

---

## Executive Summary

The POC Agent System enables users to rapidly transform product ideas into deployable proof-of-concept applications through conversational AI guidance. The system uses a two-stage agent approach: first gathering business requirements through natural conversation, then generating detailed implementation instructions optimized for Cursor AI development.

---

## Problem Statement

Technical founders and product teams struggle to quickly validate ideas through working prototypes. The gap between concept and running code is filled with architecture decisions, boilerplate setup, and implementation details that slow down validation cycles. Current solutions either require significant technical expertise or produce non-deployable mockups.

---

## Product Vision

A conversational system that transforms "I want to build X" into a fully functional, deployed POC within hours, not weeks, by combining AI-powered requirements gathering with AI-assisted development through Cursor.

---

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Technical Founders:** Need rapid POC validation for startup ideas
- **Product Managers:** Want functional prototypes to test with users
- **Internal Innovation Teams:** Building internal tools quickly

### User Characteristics
- Basic technical understanding but not expert developers
- Comfortable with conversation-based interfaces
- Value speed over perfection for initial validation
- Willing to iterate based on feedback

---

## Success Metrics

1. **Time to POC:** < 4 hours from idea to deployed prototype
2. **User Satisfaction:** 4.5+ rating on "ease of building POC"
3. **Deployment Success Rate:** > 90% of generated POCs deploy successfully
4. **Iteration Speed:** < 30 minutes to implement PRD changes
5. **Adoption:** 3 active users building 2+ POCs per month

---

## Core User Flow

### Phase 1: Idea to PRD (15-30 minutes)
1. User describes POC idea conversationally
2. Agent asks clarifying questions about:
   - Business goal and problem solving
   - Target users and their needs
   - Key features and workflows
   - Success criteria
   - Similar products or inspiration
3. User optionally uploads:
   - Wireframes or UI mockups
   - Reference documents
   - Competitor examples
   - LLM-generated ideas
4. Agent presents complete PRD for review
5. User chooses: "Keep Improving" or "Ready to Implement"

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning (5-10 minutes)
1. System generates detailed Cursor instructions
2. Instructions include:
   - Exact directory structure to create
   - File-by-file implementation plan
   - Testing checkpoints at each phase
   - Git commit strategy
   - Deployment configuration
3. User reviews and confirms plan

### Phase 3: Development (2-3 hours)
1. User opens Cursor with generated instructions
2. Cursor AI (Claude Sonnet 4.5) implements:
   - Phase 1: Frontend (test on localhost)
   - Phase 2: Backend API (test endpoints)
   - Phase 3: Database (test persistence)
   - Phase 4: Integration (E2E testing)
3. Built-in testing at each checkpoint
4. Automatic git commits following best practices

### Phase 4: Deployment (10-15 minutes)
1. Push to dedicated tenant branch
2. Azure deployment via CI/CD
3. POC accessible at tenant-specific URL
4. Admin panel auto-included for data management

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
1. **User Volume:** Designed for 2-3 concurrent users initially
2. **Tenant Limit:** Hardcoded for 3 tenants (scalable later)
3. **Stack Specificity:** Tightly coupled to FastAPI + React 19 stack
4. **LLM Dependency:** Requires OpenAI and Anthropic API access
5. **Development Tool:** Requires Cursor AI with Claude Sonnet 4.5

### Assumptions
1. Users have basic familiarity with git workflows
2. Users can test on localhost
3. Azure deployment pipeline is pre-configured
4. Users understand the POC is MVP-quality, not production-ready
5. Stack reference document is kept up-to-date manually initially

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- PRD generation: < 2 minutes for complete conversation
- Cursor instructions generation: < 30 seconds
- File uploads: Support up to 10MB per file
- Concurrent sessions: Support 3 active conversations

### Reliability
- Conversation persistence: 100% (no lost sessions)
- Deployment success rate: > 90%
- Uptime: 99% for base system

### Security
- Tenant isolation: Complete separation of code and data
- File uploads: Validated and sanitized
- API authentication: Required for all tenant endpoints
- Secrets management: Environment variables, not hardcoded

### Maintainability
- Stack reference auto-regeneration capability
- Clear separation between base and tenant code
- Version control for all generated artifacts
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| LLM generates incorrect Cursor instructions | High | Medium | Multi-layer validation, testing checkpoints, stack reference accuracy |
| Tenant deployments break base system | High | Low | Isolated route prefixes, deployment validation, rollback capability |
| Users provide incomplete requirements | Medium | High | Comprehensive question templates, upload prompts, PRD validation |
| Stack reference becomes outdated | Medium | High | Scheduled regeneration script, change detection, version tracking |
| Cursor AI deviates from instructions | Medium | Medium | Strong projman.mdc rules, confidence thresholds, testing gates |

## Dependencies

### External Services
- OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo for PRD generation)
- Anthropic API (Claude Sonnet 4.5 for Cursor instructions)

## Open Questions

1. **Git branching strategy:** Separate branch per POC vs. directory-based isolation?
2. **Azure deployment:** Single instance with dynamic routing vs. multiple slots?
3. **Stack reference maintenance:** Who owns updates? Manual vs. automated triggers?
4. **PRD template customization:** Should templates be user-editable?
5. **Cursor rules evolution:** How do we version and test projman.mdc changes?
