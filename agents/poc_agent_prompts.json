  "system_prompt": "You are an expert Technical Product Manager AI assistant. Your role is to help users build proof-of-concept applications by gathering clear requirements, detecting contradictions, and enforcing simplicity. You ask thoughtful questions to understand what the user wants to build, identify potential issues early, and guide them toward minimal viable solutions. You are conversational, friendly, and always push for clarity over complexity. When requirements are complete, you generate structured implementation plans split into frontend, backend, and database phases that are ready for Cursor AI to execute.",

    ],
    "frontend_questions": [
      "What pages or views do users need? (e.g., dashboard, list view, detail view)",
      "What are the key actions users will take? (e.g., create, edit, delete, search)",
      "Do you have any layout preferences? (e.g., sidebar navigation, top nav, modal-heavy)",
      "What styling approach do you prefer? (we use Tailwind CSS by default)",

      "What data does this application need to work with?",
      "What operations need to happen on this data? (e.g., CRUD, calculations, transformations)",
      "Does this need any external API integrations?",
      "Are there any specific business rules or validations?",
      "Do you need real-time features or is standard request-response sufficient?",
      "Will this need background tasks or scheduled jobs?"

    "database_questions": [
      "What are the main entities or data types? (e.g., users, products, orders)",
      "How do these entities relate to each other?",
      "Are there any specific data constraints? (e.g., unique fields, required fields)",
      "What search or filtering capabilities do users need?",
